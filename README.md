# Rust Tutorial

Requires the rust toolchain installation, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installation for details.

# hello world
The simplest possible

Create: `cargo new`
Run: `cargo run`

# nac 1

Noughts and Crosses CLI

Covers more ground, but less interesting

# nac 2

Noughts and Crosses GUI

More interesting, but maybe more slint and less rust?
